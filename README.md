# Hate Crime Analysis in the US from 2015 to 2019
# Background and Abstract
The rise of hate crimes in recent years have impacted many people in the United States. It is predicted that around 7,894 and 8,286 incidents will be reported in 2020 and 2021, respectively. The main causes of hate crimes are biases towards race / ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation, with racially motivated hate crimes accounting for more than half of the incidents in any given year. Among all the racially motivated hate crimes, anti-black, anti-white, and anti-hispanic are the most prominent. The analysis of known offenders by race shows that the major group of perpetrators are white and African American. In addition, most hate crimes occur at the rest area, hotel, and rental storage, largely due to the lack of security measures. Since hate crimes occur in every state in the United States, it is important that the state and federal government implement solutions to mitigate the hate crimes. At both the state and federal government levels, we recommend improving security measures, increasing reporting and resources, improving the training of responders, and incorporating multicultural education. We hope these recommendations will help to build a safer, more multicultural environment for all members of the public.

The bubble graph shows the number of incidents, offenses, and victims of racially motivated hate crimes broken down by race from 2015 to 2019. The size of the dot corresponds to the number of victims of each racially motivated hate crime. Most victims are anti-black, anti-white, and anti-hispanic. There was a dramatic increase of anti-black hate crimes from 2016 to 2017, a large decrease of anti-white hate crime from 2018 to 2019, and a steady increase of anti-asian and anti-hispanic hate crimes from 2016 to 2019. The state and federal government could use this data analysis to plan out specific policies to combat racial hate crimes, especially focusing on mitigating anti-black, anti-hispanic, and anti-asian hate crimes.

This stacked bar chart shows the breakdown of known offenders of hate crime by race. The main group of offenders were found to be white, african americans, unknown race, and multiple races from 2015 to 2019. Only a few hate crime incidents were committed by asian and American Indian / Alaska Native. There was also a slight increase in the number of white offenders from 2015 to 2019. The number of known offenders are consistent across all 5 years, with a slight increase of white offenders.

The stacked bar graph shows the number of hate crime incidents broken down by the types of biases from 2015 to 2019. Other biases include disability, gender, gender identity and multiple-bias incidents. As shown in the graph, the majority of hate crimes are motivated by race, religion or sexual orientation. Also, more than half of hate crimes in any given year are motivated by race/ethnicity and ancestry. Since racial bias is the major reason contributing to hate crimes, there needs to be policies and measures in place that specifically target racial hate crimes.

This graph shows a detailed analysis of the major locations where hate crime incidents take place. Most hate crimes happen at the rest area, hotel, rental storage facility, street, and residence, largely due to the lack of security measures at those places. Therefore, the state and federal government should increase security measures in those areas to decrease hate crimes.
