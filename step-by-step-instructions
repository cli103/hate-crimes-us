1. Generate a line graph of the total incidents of hate crimes from 2015-2019
2. Insert markers for the line graph
3. Generate a trend line for the graph
4. Display the trend line equation and r squared value
5. Use the trend line equation to calculate the number of predicted incidents for 2020 and 2021
6. Add the data for 2020 and 2021 to the graph
7. Select the lines between 2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021 and change them to a dotted line
8. Select the markers for 2020 and 2021 and select ‘no fill’

Locations of hate crimes
1. Take an average of the incidents at each location from 2015 to 2019
2. Insert filter, rearrange the averaged values in descending order, and include the averaged values larger than 100
3. Make a bar graph of the averaged incident by location
